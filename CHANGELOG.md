## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `JAN0006`: a caught exception that is neither handled nor reported now fails the
  build.
- `Result`, `Result<T>`, `Error` and `ErrorCode` in `Janus.Core`: an expected outcome
  is handled through `Match` or `Switch` and carries a code from the catalogue.
- `NeverLoggedAttribute` in `Janus.Core`: a value marked with it cannot be passed to
  a logging call.
- `Settings` in `Janus.Core.Configuration`: every configuration key with its type,
  its default, the floors, ceilings and value sets it admits, and the two rules that
  hold over a pair of keys rather than over one.
- `IConfigurationStore` in `Janus.Core.Configuration`: the keys that change at runtime
  are read through it, so a change made through the management application takes
  effect without a restart.
- `StartupException` in `Janus.Core`: a deployment that omits a value it has to name,
  or names one outside its key's bounds, now fails at startup rather than at the first
  request that needs the value.
- `Policy`, `Policies` and the step-up, factor and assurance vocabularies in
  `Janus.Core`: the policy a principal resolves to, with the system and
  administrative defaults. A policy refuses an assurance floor outside `aal1` and
  `aal2`, and refuses the emergency credential as a login factor.
- `config.value.notallowed`: a configuration value outside its key's set, or of the
  wrong type, is now refused with its own code.
- The rest of the error catalogue: a missing deployment declaration, a model
  reference to something the host never declared, the three preference refusals, a
  required challenge, a grant with no reason, the last alert destination, and an
  unhandled fault.
- `CapabilityResidual`, `ConsentMechanism`, `AgeGroup`, `AlertCondition` and
  `BotDefenceSignal` in `Janus.Core`: what still stands between a principal and an
  action, where a consent record was made, what the age screen recorded, which
  condition raised an alert, and what bot defence counts.
